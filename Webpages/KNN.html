            <p>Before doing any feature selection, I performed a pd.get_dummies and kept all inputs
              except 'Score', 'Class', and 'Case No'.  K=21 appeared to be where the graph leveled off, 
              so using 21 neighbors, I got an accuracy score of 0.925. Because K-Nearest Neighbors doesn't 
              have its own feature selections method, I used ExtraTreesClassifier to determine the heighest
              weighted inputs. Making up the top 11 features were all 10 questions, plus Age.  Age ranked tenth,
              and question 'A8' was ranked at 11, only behind by a weight of two ten-thousandth.
            </p>
            <p>After performing a gridsearch to tune the hyperparameters, the testing score did bump up, from 
              .925 to ~.947.  I then proceeded to alter the feature selection five times.  In addition to the
              questions, I focused on Age, Family History of ASD, Jaundice, and Sex. Though ethnicity inputs of
              'white' and 'middle eastern' ranked 12th and 13th, I chose to not focus on ehtnicity because two 
              ethnicies accounted for the overwhelming majority.
          </p> 
          <p>Through the five feature selection iterations, one-by-one, I removed the aforementioned features
            I had chosen to focus on, so I eventually was left with only the 10 AQ-10 questions as inputs.  The
            highest testing score came in the last iteration, with only the questions as inputs.
          </p> 
           
          <p><u>Some interesting notes:</u>  
          
          <ul>

            <li>Even though Age ranked within the top 10 inputs, there wasn't
              any variance in the testing score after gridsearch (though the variance was ~1.1% for the testing score
              before hyerparameter tuning).
            </li> 
            <li>Hyperparameter tuning: algorithm jumped around a bit between auto, brute,
              and ball_tree.  The computer chose neighbors of 19-21 for a majority of the feature selection tests.
            </li> 
            <li>Precision: The precision of the '1' label (1 = classification of yes for ASD) didn't improve until 
              the last feature selection tweak. It jumped from 0.91 to .97 in the final feature selection, where I removed 
              all except for the questions. I don't think it has to do with the smaller sample size since it isn't 
              across-the-board. Unsure where this is stemming from, might be something to explore.
