            <p>While our machine learning models focused on the 10 questions from the AQ-10 Questionnaire as inputs,
              we also analyzed the makeup of the dataset.  In addition to individual plus at-large scoring for each 
              participant, the dataset also contains information on broader societal groupings for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>Of particular interest to our group were Family History of ASD, Sex, Age, Ethnicity, and User Type.  We 
               initially hypothesized that family history would be an important factor in the machine learning, but it's 
               actually a weak correlation according to our models.
            </p>
            <p>As we did feature selection, we noticed that both white and middle eastern ethnicities were weighted highly, 
              even higher than even sex or family history.  Of note, participants of white or middle eastern ethnicities
              make up an overwhelming majority of the dataset. We did look at the ethnic breakdown of all users, and also 
              compared the rates of autism within the whole group to rates within each ethnicity.  It could be beneficial to
              analyze a more evenly distributed ethnic classification.  Because Autism is a global medical
              diagnosis, further ethnic analysis could help to hone ML detection globally.  Or upon further analysis, we might 
              find that ethnicity is of very small significance. 
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, we explored how user type might impact the results of the machine learning models.  User types included:
              parent, self, relative, healthcare professional, friend, others, and teacher.  We created a series of boxplots
              to analyze the score distribution (ranging from 0 to 10) based on the user, and broken apart by classification. 
              We found that there appears to be a stable median 50% across both groups. This could indicate that the test is 
              viable in terms of giving steady results, not largely swayed based on who's taking it.
