            <h3><u>Objectives</u></h3>
            <p class = "pt-3">We thought it would be interesting to use data we found on Autism Diagnoses from Fadi Thabtah, who had used these data
               sets for his own machine learning projects.  He is currently a professor of Computer Science & Data Analytics at New Zealand's
               Manukau Institute of Technology.  The data sets and publications on the data sets can be 
              found <a href="http://fadifayez.com/publications/#datasets" target="_blank">here.</a>  We focused on the Adults dataset.
            </p>
            <p>Professor Thabtah's objectives for his machine learning model were to explore a ML technique called Covering, which is an understudied
               classification approach. He and his colleagues set out to create a new Autism Detection method based in Covering.
            </p>  
            <p>We set out to dive deeper into machine learning with this dataset as our vehicle.  We decided to explore K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
               Regression, and Random Forest.

            <h4><u>Origins of the Dataset</u></h4>
            <p class = "pt-3">The dataset is composed of user information compiled thru an app, created soley for research
              purposes.  The app is based on something called the AQ-10, which is a condensed version of the clincally
              accepted diagnostic tool, the AQ test.  The AQ-10 consists of the ten most statistically effective
              questions. (NOTE: The AQ-10 is not new with this dataset; it is not part of the machine learning).
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><u>The Data's Structure</u></h4>
              <li class = "pt-3">There are two classification labels, 'yes' and 'no' (yes = an ASD diagnosis of yes)</li>
              <li>While the users of the ASDTests app could answer each question with "Definitely", "Slightly Agree", or 
                 "Slightly Disagree". Then, based on how the user answered, their responses were put into binary format
                 of 0's and 1's.</li>
              <li>While the ASDTests app asks users their age range, this dataset has been cleaned, so the row 'Screening
                  Type' is irrelevant.</li>
              <li>The 'Score' column ranges from 0 to 10, so depending on the ML method, that column needs to be scaled.</li>
              <li>Score ('Class' is our label column) is highly tied to questions A1 thru A10.  Something to keep in mind.</li>
              <li>Overall it's a very clean dataset with only one null row.</li>
              <li>It's interesting to note all of the data outside of the AQ-10 questions.  We're unsure of the thought process
                  behind including these questions in the ASDTests app.  Interesting because the AQ-10 questions were the best 
                  feature selection group for us, but it appears that the app creator has worked substantially with autism.  What is
                  his thought process and is there more to glean here?

            <h3 class = "title">Analysis Beyond Machine Learning</h3>
            <p class = "pt-3">While our machine learning models focused on the 10 questions from the AQ-10 Questionnaire as inputs,
              we also analyzed the makeup of the dataset.  In addition to individual plus at-large scoring for each 
              participant, the dataset also contains information on broader societal groupings for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>Of particular interest to our group were Family History of ASD, Sex, Age, Ethnicity, and User Type.  We 
               initially hypothesized that family history would be an important factor in the machine learning, but it's 
               actually a weak correlation according to our models.
            </p>
            <p>As we did feature selection, we noticed that both white and middle eastern ethnicities were weighted highly, 
              even higher than even sex or family history.  Of note, participants of white or middle eastern ethnicities
              make up an overwhelming majority of the dataset. We did look at the ethnic breakdown of all users, and also 
              compared the rates of autism within the whole group to rates within each ethnicity.  It could be beneficial to
              analyze a more evenly distributed ethnic classification.  Because Autism is a global medical
              diagnosis, further ethnic analysis could help to hone ML detection globally.  Or upon further analysis, we might 
              find that ethnicity is of very small significance. 
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, we explored how user type might impact the results of the machine learning models.  User types included:
              parent, self, relative, healthcare professional, friend, others, and teacher.  We created a series of boxplots
              to analyze the score distribution (ranging from 0 to 10) based on the user, and broken apart by classification. 
              We found that there appears to be a stable median 50% across both groups. This could indicate that the test is 
              viable in terms of giving steady results, not largely swayed based on who's taking it.
