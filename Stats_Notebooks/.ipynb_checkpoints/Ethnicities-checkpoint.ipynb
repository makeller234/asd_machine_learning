    "As found in 'Other_Stats', the percentage of participants with autism is ~32%, without ~68%.  What can we really tell from the ethnic data that we have?  Could the 'white' designation be an indictor?  We looked at that because it was the first ethnicity to appear on the feature selection, and it appeared higher than even sex or family history, which was surprising to us.  White might be more of a factor than other ethnicities because it's larger than all the others.     \n",

    "This could be something to explore more in-depth.  Given the accuracy with machine learning, how might ethnicity play a role?  It could be helpful to analyze more evenly distributed ethnic classification.  Because Autism is a global medical diagnosis, further ethnic analysis could help to hone ML detection globally.  Or upon further analysis, we might find that ethnicity is of very small significance."
