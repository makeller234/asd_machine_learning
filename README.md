## Background     
In this repo, we explore using machine learning to detect autism in adults.  We inititally found the dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autism+Screening+Adult).  After doing some digging, we found the author's homepage which contains the most current dataset. You can find both the csv and original publication by navigating to our `Resources` folder.
